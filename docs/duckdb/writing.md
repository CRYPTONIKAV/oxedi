# Writing with COPY

`COPY ... TO ... (FORMAT edi835, ...)` writes an 835 from SQL. It uses the same writer as the
Python package's `oxedi.write`. For the same tables and envelope, the file is byte for byte
what `oxedi.write` gives.

!!! warning "Needs extension 0.2.0"
    Writing with `COPY` needs extension 0.2.0 or later. Until it reaches the community
    repository, build the extension (see [Install](index.md#install)).

## Write a file

The query you copy returns **one `STRUCT` column**:

- Its fields are named after the spec's tables.
- Each field is a list of structs: one struct per row, with the table's columns as fields.

This example reads the tables of a file into temporary tables:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE payments AS FROM read_835('remittance.835', table_name := 'payments');
CREATE TEMP TABLE claims AS FROM read_835('remittance.835', table_name := 'claims');
CREATE TEMP TABLE services AS FROM read_835('remittance.835', table_name := 'services');
CREATE TEMP TABLE adjustments AS FROM read_835('remittance.835', table_name := 'adjustments');
CREATE TEMP TABLE provider_adjustments AS
  FROM read_835('remittance.835', table_name := 'provider_adjustments');
```

Then it writes them back:

```sql
COPY (
  SELECT {
    'payments':             (SELECT list(t ORDER BY t."row") FROM payments t),
    'claims':               (SELECT list(t ORDER BY t."row") FROM claims t),
    'services':             (SELECT list(t ORDER BY t."row") FROM services t),
    'adjustments':          (SELECT list(t ORDER BY t."row") FROM adjustments t),
    'provider_adjustments': (SELECT list(t ORDER BY t."row") FROM provider_adjustments t)
  }
) TO 'out.835' (FORMAT edi835, sender_id 'ACMEPAYER', receiver_id 'SUNRISECLINIC',
                date DATE '2024-01-10', time TIME '09:00');
```

The new file reads back like any other:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS claims, sum(payment_amount) AS paid FROM read_835('out.835');
```

```text
┌────────┬───────────────┐
│ claims │     paid      │
│ int64  │ decimal(38,2) │
├────────┼───────────────┤
│      4 │        720.00 │
└────────┴───────────────┘
```

- `payments`, `claims` and the rest can be any tables or views with those names. Build them in
  SQL, or read them from a file as above and change them before writing.
- Temporary tables, views and the open transaction are visible.
- The lists of several rows of the query concatenate into one interchange.
- A table left out has no rows. A column left out is null.

## Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sender_id`, `receiver_id` | required | interchange sender and receiver ids |
| `date`, `time` | required | the interchange date (`DATE`) and time (`TIME` or `TIME_NS`) |
| `sender_qualifier`, `receiver_qualifier` | `'ZZ'` | ISA qualifiers |
| `usage_indicator` | `'P'` | `'P'` production or `'T'` test |
| `control_number` | `1` | first interchange control number |
| `application_sender`, `application_receiver` | the ids | group header sender and receiver codes |
| `delimiters` | `*` `:` `~` `^` | a struct of delimiters (see below) |
| `line_break` | `false` | a line break after each segment |
| `version` | `'5010'` | the built-in spec, `'5010'` or `'4010'` |

The options are those of [`oxedi.Envelope`](../python/writing.md#fill-in-the-envelope), with the
same defaults.

??? note "Details: the `delimiters` struct"
    Pass a struct such as `{'element': '|', 'repetition': '^'}` with any of `element`,
    `component`, `segment`, `repetition` and `release`. Fields left out take the defaults of
    `oxedi.Delimiters()`: `*`, `:`, `~`, and no repetition or release. So on 5010, give
    `repetition`.

## When COPY refuses

`COPY` is strict, like `oxedi.write`. The written file is read back with the spec. Every
diagnostic of that read is a finding, and so is anything the writer cannot place:

- A missing required element.
- A code outside its list.
- A row whose parent does not exist or is out of order.
- Money that does not balance.

Any finding fails the `COPY` with the listing `oxedi.WriteError` shows, each finding naming the
table, row and column. Nothing is written. There is no `allow_findings` here yet.
[When the writer refuses a file](../python/when-write-refuses.md) explains findings in detail.

## Write from your own tables

The writer asks for the spec's names and nothing else. Tables built elsewhere work when they
follow them.

Tolerated:

- A missing table (no rows).
- A missing column (null).
- A column of a narrower or compatible type: `INTEGER` for `BIGINT`, a `DECIMAL` of another
  scale that holds the value, `ENUM` or `BLOB` for text.

Refused, naming the table, row and column:

- A table or column that is not in the spec.
- A float for money.
- A value that would change in the conversion: a decimal that does not fit, or a number outside
  the column's range.
- A file that does not balance or is missing a required element.

To number rows from tables with your own keys, see
[Writing from your tables](../python/own-tables.md#translate-your-keys) (SQL tab).
[Types and limits](limits.md) lists the accepted types per column.

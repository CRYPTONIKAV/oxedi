# When the writer refuses a file

The writer is strict: it writes a file only when the file would be valid. This page shows what
it reports when it refuses, how to write anyway, and how it treats money and empty text.

The examples start from the tables and envelope of [Writing 835 files](writing.md):

```python
import datetime
from decimal import Decimal

import polars as pl
import oxedi

result = oxedi.parse_file("remittance.835")
frames = result.tables.to_polars()
envelope = oxedi.Envelope(
    sender_id="ACMEPAYER",
    receiver_id="SUNRISECLINIC",
    date=datetime.date(2024, 1, 10),
    time=datetime.time(9, 0),
    usage_indicator="T",
)
```

## See why a file was refused

Raise the payment of the first claim by 10.00, so the money no longer balances, and write:

```python
frames["claims"] = frames["claims"].with_columns(
    payment_amount=pl.when(pl.col("row") == 0)
    .then(pl.lit(Decimal("210.00")))
    .otherwise(pl.col("payment_amount"))
)

try:
    data = oxedi.write(frames, envelope, spec=result.spec)
except oxedi.WriteError as error:
    for finding in error.findings:
        print(finding.table, finding.row, finding.column)
```

```text
claims 0 charge_amount
payments 0 total_payment_amount
```

- `oxedi.WriteError` is a `ValueError`. Its message lists every finding. Nothing is written.
- `error.findings` holds each one as an `oxedi.WriteFinding`. A finding names the table, row
  and column, or the envelope field, with the diagnostic behind it.
- Here the claim no longer balances, and neither does the payment's total.

    ```

## What counts as a finding

The written file is read back with the spec. Every diagnostic of that read is a finding, and so
is anything the writer cannot place. For example:

- A required element or occurrence without a value.
- A value outside its code list or its length.
- A row whose parent does not exist, or that comes out of order.
- A value holding a delimiter.
- Money that does not balance.

!!! note "A value holding a delimiter"
    This one is reported first. The file then splits where the data does not, so it cannot be
    read back. The other findings show once that value is fixed.

## Write anyway

With `allow_findings=True`, `write` returns `(data, findings)` instead of raising. Use it, for
example, to produce invalid files for tests:

```python
data, findings = oxedi.write(frames, envelope, spec=result.spec, allow_findings=True)
print(len(findings))
```

```text
2
```

## Money is never changed

The writer checks the balancing rules. It never uses them to fill in a total:

- `BPR02` against the claims' payments and the `PLB` adjustments.
- Each claim's and each service's charge minus payment against their `CAS` adjustments.

!!! warning "Interest"
    The claim rule does not model interest (`AMT*I`). A claim whose payment includes interest
    does not balance, and is refused unless you set `allow_findings`.

## Null and empty text

In text columns:

- `null` is an element the segment does not have.
- `""` is an element it has but leaves empty.

A null cell in the middle of a segment is still written as an empty element, so it reads back
as `""`. Only trailing nulls read back as `null`. The tables of a parse write back to the same
tables.

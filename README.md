# oxedi

A fast, lossless parser and writer for X12 EDI 835 files (electronic remittance advice). The
core is written in Rust and is available from Python and from DuckDB.

- **Lossless.** Every byte of the file is kept. Nothing is silently dropped, and the file can
  be written back exactly as it was read.
- **Ready-made tables.** Payments, claims, service lines and adjustments come out as typed
  tables that open in Polars, pandas, pyarrow or DuckDB.
- **Problems are reported, not raised.** Questionable data still parses. Each issue is a
  diagnostic that names the rule, the position and the value.

Documentation: **<https://javillegas.dev/oxedi/latest/>**. New here? Start with the
[five-minute tutorial](https://javillegas.dev/oxedi/latest/start/), or
**[try it in your browser](https://javillegas.dev/oxedi/viewer/)**: drop a file on the page and
see its tables and problems. Nothing is uploaded.

## Install

```bash
pip install oxedi                    # no Python dependencies
pip install "oxedi[polars]"          # or [pandas], [pyx12], [edi-835-parser]
```

Requires Python 3.11 or later. For DuckDB:

<!-- docs-test: skip the runner loads the locally built extension; INSTALL needs the network -->
```sql
INSTALL oxedi FROM community;
LOAD oxedi;
```

`INSTALL` gives extension 0.1.x, which reads files. Writing with `COPY` needs 0.2.0, which is
not in the community repository yet. See [DuckDB](https://javillegas.dev/oxedi/latest/duckdb/).

## Read

```python
import oxedi

result = oxedi.parse_file("remittance.835")      # or oxedi.parse(data) from bytes

claims = result.tables["claims"].to_polars()     # or .to_pandas()
print(result.count_claims(), result.sum_payments())  # sum_payments() is a Decimal
print(result.payer["name"], result.payee["name"])

for diagnostic in result.diagnostics:            # problems come back as data
    print(diagnostic)
```

A file that is not an 835 raises `oxedi.ParseError`; anything else parses. `oxedi.stream`
yields one transaction at a time for large files.

## Write

Parse, change a value, write:

```python
import datetime
import polars as pl

frames = result.tables.to_polars()               # {table name: polars frame}
frames["payments"] = frames["payments"].with_columns(trace_number=pl.lit("CHK100235"))

envelope = oxedi.Envelope(
    sender_id="ACMEPAYER",
    receiver_id="SUNRISECLINIC",
    date=datetime.date(2024, 1, 10),
    time=datetime.time(9, 0),
)
data = oxedi.write(frames, envelope, spec=result.spec)  # bytes, one interchange
```

The writer is strict: if the money does not balance or the file would not read back clean, it
raises `oxedi.WriteError` and writes nothing.

## DuckDB

```sql
FROM read_835('remits/*.835', table_name := 'services', filename := true);

-- the findings of the parse, one row each
FROM read_835('remits/*.835', table_name := 'diagnostics', ignore_errors := true);
```
